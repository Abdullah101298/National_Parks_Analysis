## Background 

Performing an analysis on whether weather, gas prices, and the population of a state affect the number of visitors to a national park. 

### APIs Used 

    (1) Dark Sky 
    (2) NPS 
    (3) Irmas 
    (4) EIA Data
    
## Part 1 - Analyzing Population vs. Visitor Count for each National Park 

Task 1: Gather census data from census library 

Task 2: Gather visitor count data from Irmas API 

Task 3: Compare the visitor count for national parks in a state with the population of the state. 

## Part 2 - Analyzing Temperature vs. Visitor Count for each National Park 

Task 1: Gather weather data from Dark Sky API. 

Task 2: Gather geographical coordinates of each national park using NPS 

Task 3: Use the geographical coordinates for the Dark Sky API to gather the temperature of each national park. 

Task 4: Compare the temperature with the previously gathered visitor count.

## Part 3 - Analyzing Gas Prices of a State vs. Visitor Count for each National Park

Task 1: Gather gas prices for certain states using EIA API. 

Task 2: Perform regression to gather data for all states. 

Task 3: Compare the gas prices with the visitor count of the national parks for each state.
